Learning a compass can help our kids to improve their understanding of cardinal directions, orientation, and navigation. This game can help improve our kids abilities in many activities that require a sense of direction, such as sports, navigating in unfamiliar environments, or even in everyday life.

This game has a story that there is an astronaut who is lost in outer space and needs our help to navigate and return to Earth. Players are asked to guess the word that appears in the correct cardinal direction

An education game about Learning Compass Direction that built on Swift Playground App.
